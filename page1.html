								<p>There are two forms of communism, Communism in the sense that society has gone through full phases of  historical phases from the discovery of private property and the final stage which follows its  abolition.<br>
									And then there is Primitive communism this is before the discovery and implementation of private property.Though it no longer has any sort  of modern day significance it can tell us things about full communism.
								For instance the critique that communism is againts human nature is emmediately debunked  because communism has existed in a primitive sense.It was  one  of the first institutions that humanity set up.There were no government structures that prevent humans from doing what was natural it was simply an intuitive natural way of doing things for them , so it tells us that communism is possible.   </p>
