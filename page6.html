									<h1>Communism</h1>
									<p></p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A communist society is characterized by common ownership of the means of production with free access to the articles  of consumption  and is classless and, stateless ,implying the end of exploitation labor.In a communist society everyone works and everyones need is provided equally ,if ur struggling your fellow is there to help you.We are all one big tribe looking for one another no one is greedy and no one takes everything for themselves.The good thing is with the current ability of production we will be able to create a world where peaople  don't actually work that much . People will be given more freedom to pursue whatever they find fulfilling. Carl Marx lays out that when the capitalism is overthrown there is a transitonal period where most land are transfered to the state.There is still an income disparity , but that disparity goees to the government in the form of massive taxes where will then be doled out to help produce income and Equality. Credit,Commuinication,and transport will be centralized by the state which is designed to mean individual interprises won't have the chance to stirr  economy as big bank and big cell phone monopoly do today.Abolition of the right of inheritance ,that means that when you die you can't pass everything to your kin.This helps  to make everyone to be born  with equal chance of opportunity.
