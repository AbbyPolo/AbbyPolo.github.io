								<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Historical materialist analysis
Marx explained the contradictions of the capitalist
Society That he lived in, the industrial capitalism
But also outlined the potential to overcome it

He Recognized that
"the history of all hitherto exist society is the
 history of class struggles"
 
 And therefore that antagonism had exissted way before
industrial capitalism as well as explaining that capitalism
Antagonism are devided and polarized into two fundamental classes,

The Buorgeoisie and the proletariat </br>


 </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1867 the first volume of das capital or "the capital" was
published the only one in Marx's lifetime.


It's a revolutionary work that explain in detail
contradictions of the capitalist mode of production.&nbsp;&nbsp;

In it marx analyze the worker-capitalist relationship
and how the exploitation of the worker is one of the central aspects
of the capitalist system..

since the worker don't own the means of production
they have no control aver their labor and , therefore
are essentially no more than  machines working to produce a 
profit for their capitalist masters 

who got rich off by not paying the workers a full value of what 
they produce .

Which is the surplus value ....
the little difference at which the product is sold 
and what they pay the worker who made it..</br></br>




"Capital is dead labour, that vampire like ,only
lives by sucking living labour , 
and lives  the more  labour it sucks ."</br></br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the ultimate goal in the capitalist system is to Maximizes
it's profits everything becomes a commodity that is bougth and paid for,
Even inpecting basic human needs such as
education , healthcare ,housing , food.</br>

Marx Argues that the capitalist system is ultimately unstable 
because it cannot endlessly increase profits...


The unsustainability of this capilist goal of endless
profits and consumption can be seen more clearly in 
our world today..

it causes numerous extinction events ,
environmental  disasters, labor exploitation
and leading to the rapid destruction of our planet
and everything in it.</p>
